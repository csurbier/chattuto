These tutorials will focus on how to create a real world mobile chat application with Ionic 5/Angular 11, Capacitor 3 and Django 3. The **Chat** application will manage private chat between two persons and not a group chat application. 
 

For this application, we can list these main functionalities :

* Login / Register / Forget password screens
* List of chats screen
* Chat screen

So we will learn each steps required to create a real world chat mobile application with it's associated backend in a day to day process.

On backend, we will use Django and Django channels to have a socket based chat and we will also learn how to save and retrieve chat history. 

On frontend, we will develop a Ionic application with angular framework, which will communicate with our backend to manage the chats. we will deploy the application on mobile devices using Capacitor.
